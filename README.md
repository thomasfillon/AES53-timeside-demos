TimeSide demonstrations
=======================

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to illustrate some basics feature of **[TimeSide](https://github.com/parisson/TimeSide)**, an Audio processing framework for the web. 

These notebooks can be executed in an *interactive* environment thanks to [Binder](http://mybinder.org/).

The notebooks can also be view online (non interactively) on the 
[Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/thomasfillon/Timeside-demos/) site.
